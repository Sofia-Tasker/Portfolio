            About Me
        </h3>
        <p>
            Life is full of opportunities, and I want to experience as many of them as I can.<br>
            I am a senior Computer Science major at Drexel University with a minor in User Experience and Interactive Design. 
            I intend to explore the possibilities that technology has to offer in both the traditional professional setting 
            and also a creative setting. <br>
            I am very passionate about the arts and integrating them into Computer Science. 
            I have been dancing for 19 years studying ballet and also Ukrainian Traditional Dance. I currently am a seven-year 
            company member and teacher of the nationally recognized Ukrainian dance group Syzokryli. Additionally, I have 
            attended The Arts Students League of New York and studied multiple mediums of art for 6 years.<br>
            I aspire to work with a diverse team of people to create efficient methods that change the face of technology. 
            I strongly believe in the promotion of women in the computing world, and working to change the world in as many 
            fields as possible.
