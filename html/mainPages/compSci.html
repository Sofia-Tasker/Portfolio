                    personal information using QR codes and relational databases to keep the

                    Created a plateform for sales representatives at Sapient Industries Inc. 
                    to use when querying data. This helped the process be more efficient 
                    and consise as the sales personelle could now directly make their own 
                    questions and calls to data.

                    Working with python's panda library, a co-worker and I developed a dashboard 
                    of visualizations. These graphs and images showed the progress of companies 
                    efficiency's as well as a visualization of when certain sockets had similar 
                    patterns that could be optimized for maximum savings.

                    Incentive Engagement is a microservice that implements a gamification system 
                    for the Incentive app. It will allow users earn points for tasks such as 
                    completing challenges, reading articles, or linking bank accounts. Users can 
                    then redeem points to earn prizes like gift cards, and will be able to compete 
                    with others in the global leaderboards. This microservice further encourages 
                    users to engage with the app through daily streaks and quizzes that only 
                    appear for a limited amount of time.
